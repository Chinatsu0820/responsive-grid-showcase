# responsive-grid-showcase
This is an online shopping website dealing with Japanese and Korean sweets.

This is the first team project in the second term. The purpose of this project is to learn how to use Responsive design, Grid, Git, and Github.

This website must have a responsive design with layouts that adapt to Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile screens using a combination of Flexbox, Grid, and media queries (refer to images from the teacher).

We must have at least 4 pages on our website; two of which must have Grids in them. Each team member must work on two pages, and one must be a Grid page.

Chinatsu : index.html, product.html(Grid) Soobeom : page1.html, page2.html(Grid)

Use git to coordinate our collaboration on the website by creating branches for each page and/or feature/component, and merging them into the main branch.
